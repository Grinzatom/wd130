            <h2>Mauricio David Grinzato Sandoval</h2>

           <p>Hello, my name is Mauricio, some of my relatives call me David. 
            I am a software development student although I am currently an electronics technician, 
            my passion has always been programming and in my current job I am dedicated to programming 
            automation and robots for industrial use.</p>

            <p>In my free time I like to play with circuits and components like Arduino as well as reading
            books. I have been married for ten years and have a 4-year-old son. I am from Venezuela, however 
            I currently live with my family in Sao Jose Dos Campos, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil and I have been
            a member of the church for 20 years.</p>

            <p>Although I love my career, I always wanted to develop myself in the area of programming 
            and software development and I have always been studying on my own waiting to formalize my 
            education and move fully into this area.</p>

            <p>Upon learning about BYU pathway, I was charmed and captivated by its method of education, 
            mainly teaching one another as part of the methodology to improve learning. It has helped me, 
            along with other techniques, to even improve my performance at work and in my studies.</p>

            <p>An advantage that I also really like when migrating professions is the flexibility of working
            in this area even from home, allowing me to better manage my time to care for my family and, in 
            turn, my calling in the church.</p>

            <p>I am truly grateful for the opportunity to return to what I like and studying with you is something 
            that from the beginning has changed and improved my life and that of my family by having a broader and 
            totally different vision. Thank you and I hope to see you soon in class.</p>
