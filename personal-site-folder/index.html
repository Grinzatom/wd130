                    Welcome to electronic for children with arduino. On this site you will
                    learn from the most basic to the most interesting about electronics with
                    practical, easy and economical applications to make. Here we will use the 
                    equivalent of free software but at the hardware level for the projects. 
                    Don't worry if some words are complicated or some projects impossible, you will
                    see how little by little you will not only master it but you will also love it
                    and once you make your first assembly and see it work you will not be able to 
                    stop. In my case I will be using components in the robocore images because it
                    is economically flexible and has the same capacity as an original one. It should
                    be noted that the fact that it is not original does not mean that it is pirated. 
                    Arduino is an opensource platform and there are many manufacturers and developers 
                    who have created their own versions of the original, including some truly amazing 
                    ones. I invite you to continue with us and venture into this great world of applied 
                    electronics and develop this good passion that will surely make you see the world 
                    around you in a different way.

        <h2 class="title-history">Brief history of arduino</h2> 

        <div id="grid-history">

            <section id="history">
                <p>
                    Arduino was born in Italy at the IVREA institute in 2005 as a response to a need to 
                    acquire low-cost microelectronics components. At that time, students in this area had 
                    to bear very high costs to carry out their practices in this area, such as the BASC Stamp
                    with a high cost of more than 100USD, which made it difficult to carry out assemblies with
                    these elements. In that year of 2005, the students who developed it decided to open the 
                    design to the general public in order to grow the project with thousands of online participants
                    creating the entire Arduino family that we know and love today.

                <h2 class="title2">Why Arduino?</h2>
                <p>
                    Its advantages apart from being open source are its easy use and scalability. These components are 
                    having wide uses in aerospace industries, medicine, construction of advanced prostheses, robotics and
                    increasingly applied in home automation (residential automation) . Its language is based on C++ with 
                    an easy-to-understand structure and on average you can purchase one of these boards for less than 15USD.
                    Its versatility and low cost comes from its simple processor called Atmel's ATMEGA328P, a powerful microcontroller that 
                    will make our projects possible with the best cost-benefit ratio on the market.

                <h2 class="title2">Until what age can I learn?</h2>
                <p>
                    There is no limit to this. There are even courses aimed at all ages and you will be able to see it as you see
                    the examples and montages. You also don't need advanced knowledge, much of what you need to know can be learned 
                    practically. Many of those who use this platform are self-taught and once you get passionate about it and start 
                    using it, the sky will be the limit.
