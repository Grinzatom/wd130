      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>invite people of the new generation to learn more about the fantastic
         world of electronics and demonstrate that anyone can learn if they want
         to do so. Arduino was originally intended as a teaching medium to teach 
         children about this area and encourage them to explore.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>We want to be a source of inspiration for those who have always been interested in it but have not had a clear reference on how to do it.
        I have been in this area for at least 10 years and I want to show you that there is no age for this and even a 6 year old child or a 60 year 
        old person could understand and at the same time have fun safely while doing it.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Welcome to electronic for children with arduino. On this site you will learn from the most basic to the most 
        interesting about electronics with practical, easy and economical applications to make. Here we will use the
         equivalent of free software but at the hardware level for the projects. Don't worry if some words are complicated 
         or some projects impossible, you will see how little by little you will not only master it but you will also love 
         it and once you make your first assembly and see it work you will not be able to stop. In my case I will be using 
         components in the robocore images because it is economically flexible and has the same capacity as an original one. 
         It should be noted that the fact that it is not original does not mean that it is pirated. Arduino is an opensource 
         platform and there are many manufacturers and developers who have created their own versions of the original, including 
         some truly amazing ones. I invite you to continue with us and venture into this great world of applied electronics
          and develop this good passion that will surely make you see the world around you in a different way.
      </p>
      <h3>Brief history of arduino</h3>
      <p>
        Arduino was born in Italy at the IVREA institute in 2005 as a response to a need to acquire low-cost microelectronics 
        components. At that time, students in this area had to bear very high costs to carry out their practices in this area,
         such as the BASC Stamp with a high cost of more than 100USD, which made it difficult to carry out assemblies with these
          elements. In that year of 2005, the students who developed it decided to open the design to the general public in order 
          to grow the project with thousands of online participants, creating the entire Arduino family that we know and love today.
      </p>
      <h3>Why arduino?</h3>
      <p>
        Its advantages apart from being open source are its easy use and scalability. These components are having wide uses in aerospace
         industries, medicine, construction of advanced prostheses, robotics and increasingly applied in home automation (residential automation)
         . Its language is based on C++ with an easy-to-understand structure and on average you can purchase one of these boards for less than 15USD.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another advantage it offers is that you can erase the memory of the board and reuse it in a new project so you will not have to buy one for each 
        assembly or test you are going to carry out. Its IDE is open and free and you can obtain it on the arduino.cc page and you have multiplatform versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its versatility comes from its simple processor called Atmel's ATMEGA328P, a powerful microcontroller that will make our projects possible with 
        the best cost-benefit ratio on the market.
      </p>

      <h3>Until what age can I learn?</h3>

      <p>There is no limit to this. There are even courses aimed at all ages and you will be able to see it as you see the examples and montages.
         You also don't need advanced knowledge, much of what you need to know can be learned practically. Many of those who use this platform are 
         self-taught and once you get passionate about it and start using it, the sky will be the limit.</p>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Look at some of our practical projects. You can achieve some of them in a couple of hours by following the assembly and code step by step.
      </p>
      <h3>LCD display project</h3>
      <p>In this project we see how to connect and transmit images to an LCD screen. For this we use an Arduino Uno, a 1602A screen, a 220ohm resistor,
         a potentiometer and some jumpers. I did this project once with a 16-year-old boy for his science class and it took us around 30 minutes to assemble 
         and about 15 minutes to program and test. In the attached image I have recreated the same setup for you</p>

         <h3>Distance ultrasom sensor</h3>
         <p>
          In this project you will learn how to use an ultrasound sensor.
          It has multiple uses as a mini radar. control liquid level or measure distances.
          For this we use an HC-SR04 sensor with an Arduino Uno and connectors as well as 
          an alarm speaker indicating when the programmed distance is reached.

      <h3>about Us</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Mauricio Grinzato, I have 16 years of experience immersed in the world of electronics. This is my passion and I really want everyone to know how wonderful the world of electronics and telecommunications is.
        I have been an instrumentation and electronics technician since 2007. Since that time I have evolved and worked in multiple areas of electronics with PLC automation and robotics. This project aims to show you that it is possible, 
        regardless of your age and origin, that you can learn and grow in this world and I am here to demonstrate with you that you can.
