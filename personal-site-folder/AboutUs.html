                    Hello, my name is Mauricio Grinzato, I have 16 years of experience
                     immersed in the world of electronics. This is my passion and I really
                      want everyone to know how wonderful the world of electronics and 
                      telecommunications is. I have been an instrumentation and electronics 
                      technician since 2007. Since that time I have evolved and worked in multiple
                       areas of electronics with PLC automation and robotics. This project aims to 
                       show you that it is possible, regardless of your age and origin, that you 
                       can learn and grow in this world and I am here to demonstrate with you that 
                       you can.
                </p>

                    Electronics for children with Arduino represents a summary of our technical experience
                     adapted to be taught to people of any age and level of academic preparation and anywhere
                      in the world. We invite you to participate and see for yourself that you can become an 
                      expert from scratch if you put your mind to it and we want to see you grow and be a new 
                      member of our community.
